              What excites me most is bridging the gap between theoretical
              research and practical applications. Whether it's detecting image
              forgeries, working with large language models, or diving into
              generative architectures, I'm always looking for problems where
              math and code can make a real difference.

              Right now, I'm deepening my expertise through advanced coursework
              in Deep Learning, 3D/Video Vision, Object Recognition, NLP, and
              Signal Processing. Each project is an opportunity to push my
              understanding further.

              Outside of code, you'll find me exploring new music, playing
              football, or hunting for the next interesting hackathon to join. I
              believe the best ideas often come from unexpected places.
